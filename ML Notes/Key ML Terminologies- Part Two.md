The process of creating machine learning models is called **TRAINING**. 

    This is where a computer uses a set of algorithms to learn about inputs and what distinguishes them from each other. So, for example, if you want a computer to recognize cats and dogs, you can use lots of pictures of both to create a model, and the computer will use that model to try to figure out what makes a cat a cat, and what makes a dog a dog. 
    
Once the model is trained, 
    
    the process of having it recognize or categorize future inputs is called INFERENCE.
